#Chapter 0

Fine, let's learn some new stuff tonight.

When I first come to the principal "Functional Programming", I was like "Man, WTF? What happened to OOP?"

Then I realized FP actually has a longer history than OOP. All those drak magic like `Haskel`, `Erlang` are FP language. Nowadays, `Python`, `Golang` also support FP. Even `Java8` has Lambda Expressions.

What will Functional Programming bring us?
	
* Closure
* High Level Function
* Lazy Evaluation
* Recursion
* Inmutable Variables
* 'Dark Magic' to show off

So, it comes to me maybe I should buy myself a brand new toy.

Due to my crappy job, I can rarely have the opportunity to touch new techs. All that boss need me to do is, "This page's js is not working properly, correct it!" , "Write some shit to move those data from mongo to sql server!", "Distribute this node server to docker!" and "Write a gateway and I want it be done today!" 

WTF man? I joined this shit-hole as an Android developer! Give me an APP for fuck sake! At least give me a Java server or something! Web pages? Fuck you. Fuck your stupid web page. Fuck you for let me clean somebody else mess. Fuck you.

I think I'll quit that shit soon.

Ok, enough chick-chat, let's get start.

One more thing, why scala?

* Scala is scalable. 
* Scala support Function Programming.
* Scala have a Java-like grammar.
* Scala can running on JVM.
* etc, etc.
